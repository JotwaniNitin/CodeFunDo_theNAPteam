# e-Elections using Blockchain

### Introduction 

India being the largest democracy in the world caters to a huge population, conducts innumerous elections and has polling booths across 29 states and union territories at multiple tiers. Referenda and polls are very important processes & tools for the smooth operation of a modern democracy.

Some of the key problems in such a widely conducted activity are rigging of polling booths, bribery and use of money power to buy votes and low voter turnouts. This significantly affects the candidates fighting in the elections and might not result in a fair electoral process.   

Our solution demonstrates how you can make these processes more secure, reliable, and transparent using Azure Blockchain.

### Solution

1. Automatic generation of voter card on turning 18

Now that AADHAR Card is mandatory for every citizen of the country this can be used as an effective database for the elible voters in a constituency. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) which allocates AADHAR will automatically register all the new AADHAR Card holders to our system. A password will be provided to be the users which can be changed later on. The system henceforth will check for the age and provide automatic voting access on turing 18. Everyone who is 18+ on the system will be assigned an e-Voter Card in real time. 

This will help increasing the turnout in elections as a lot of citizens do not make their voter cards given the long rigmarole of an offline application for the same. 

2. Remote Voting Access

Our model now has an online database of all the eligble voters in the country. The system is an e voting platform which is app and web based wherein a voter can sign in during elections to cast his or her vote. Unlike the current practice, wherein a person can only vote in the constituency where his/her address (as mentioned in the voter card) falls, our model allows a person to vote from aywhere in the country and even overseas. 

This will bring about a significant participation in the electoral process as this will allow people to vote in a click of a button or in the comfort of their home. 

For a similar experience in rural areas with no or poor internet access, mobile pooling booths with desktops or smartphones should be installed for the people living nearby. 

For security reasons, the systems will verify the user on many folds like password, OTP and facial recognition. There will also be MAC filtering for each device in the backend wherein devices used to cast multiple votes will be notified to the ECI (Election Commission of India) to avoid illegitimate votes. 

3. Expedite Vote Counting 

Using the blockchain technology, the system automatically calcultes the number of votes of each candidate which is a node in the chain. This is later fed to a software with other details like the constituency id and party id to generate elections results quickly. 

This saves huge amounts of time and the need to transport EVMs from one place to another. This also rules down cases of EVM hacking and other malpractices while vote counting. 

4. Financial Transparency 

It often happens that major political parties have an obvious advantage where they can use an excess of money power to ‘buy’ votes with bribery. Even while campaigning, smaller parties have a disadvantage since they don’t have as much money or power as the bigger parties. The EIC sanctions a certain budget which a party needs to stick to, but there have been innumerous cases of exceeding it using black money. 

On our system, the EIC can give each politcal party some token budget on the application. This is then shown to be deducted virtually by the party against all its real-money expenditure. Here, we can keep a track of the purchases of the party and any purchase not highlighted on the application and caught in the public domain by the general people and media shall be then reported.
